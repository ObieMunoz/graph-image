- Automatically resize images according to your design specifications
- Dynamically serve .webp format where supported, ensuring modern compression techniques are utilized for-aster load times
- Generate device-specific variants to ensure optimal download size
- Prioritize initial page speed and conserve bandwidth
- Employ the 'blur-up' technique or a solid background for seamless image loading experiences
- Prevent page layout jumps with consistent image positioning

## Quickstart

Here's an example using a static asset object.

```html
<script>
    import { GraphImage } from "graph-image";

    const asset = {
        handle: "uQrLj1QRWKJnlQv1sEmC",
        width: 800,
        height: 800
    }
</script>

<GraphImage image={asset} maxWidth={800} />
<GraphImage
	title="Example 2"
	alt="Example 2"
	image={{ handle: asset.handle, width: 1920, height: 1080 }}
	withWebp
	maxWidth={500}
	style={{
		width: '500px',
		margin: '32px 16px'
	}}
/>
```

## Props

| Name                | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`             | `object`                         | An object of shape `{ handle, width, height }`. Handle is an identifier required to display the image and both `width` and `height` are required to display a correct placeholder and aspect ratio for the image. You can get all 3 by just putting all 3 in your image-getting query. |
| `maxWidth`          | `number`                         | Maximum width you'd like your image to take up. (ex. If your image container is resizing dynamically up to a width of 1200, put it as a `maxWidth`)                                                                                                                                    |
| `fadeIn`            | `bool`                           | Do you want your image to fade in on load? Defaults to `true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `fit`               | `"clip"\|"crop"\|"scale"\|"max"` | When resizing the image, how would you like it to fit the new dimensions? Defaults to `crop`. You can read more about resizing [here](https://www.filestack.com/docs/api/processing/#resize)                                                                                           |
| `withWebp`          | `bool`                           | If webp is supported by the browser, the images will be served with `.webp` extension. (Recommended)                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `transforms`        | `array`                          | Array of `string`s, each representing a separate Filestack transform, eg. `['sharpen=amount:5', 'quality=value:75']`                                                                                                                                                                   |
